## Prerequisites
- [ ] If you have accidentally deleted a Service Plan please read the following:
  - [ ] [MySQL 1.8](http://docs.pivotal.io/p-mysql/1-8/known-issues.html#service-plan-deletion)
  - [ ] [MySQL 1.7](http://docs.pivotal.io/p-mysql/1-7/known-issues.html#service-plan-deletion)

## Symptoms

The service plan you expect to exist is no longer available. If and only if the Operator does all of these steps in sequence, a plan will become “unrecoverable”:
  1. Click the trash-can icon in the Service Plan screen
  2. Enter a plan with the exact same name
  3. Click the ‘Save’ button on the same screen
  4. Return to the Ops Manager top-level, and click 'Apply Changes’
After clicking 'Apply Changes’, the deploy will eventually fail with the error:
```
Server error, status code: 502, error code: 270012, message: Service broker catalog is invalid: Plan names must be unique within a service
```

## Procedure

### Triage (Required)
  - [ ] If you have committed steps 1 and 2, but not 4, no problem. Do not hit the 'Save’ button. Simply return to the Installation Dashboard. Any accidental changes will be discarded.
  - [ ] If you have committed steps 1, 2 and 3, do not click 'Apply Changes.’ Instead, return to the Installation Dashboard and click the ’Revert’ button. Any accidental changes will be discarded.
